    <h1>BOM (Browser Object Model) in JavaScript</h1>

    <p>The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a set of objects provided by the browser that allow JavaScript to interact with the browser environment. Unlike the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of a document, the BOM provides objects and methods for interacting with the browser itself.</p>

    <h2>1. Window Object</h2>

    <p>The <code>window</code> object represents the browser window or tab. It serves as the global object for JavaScript code running in the browser, providing access to various properties and methods for controlling the browser environment.</p>

    <h2>2. Navigator Object</h2>

    <p>The <code>navigator</code> object provides information about the browser's name, version, and platform. It also includes properties related to browser features such as cookies, geolocation, and user agent information.</p>

    <h2>3. Location Object</h2>

    <p>The <code>location</code> object represents the current URL of the browser window. It provides properties and methods for navigating to different URLs, accessing query parameters, and modifying the browser's history.</p>

    <h2>4. Screen Object</h2>

    <p>The <code>screen</code> object provides information about the user's screen, such as its dimensions and pixel depth. It allows developers to create responsive designs and adjust the layout based on the user's screen size and resolution.</p>

    <h2>Examples:</h2>

    <div class="code"><pre>
// Example accessing window properties
console.log(window.innerWidth);
console.log(window.location.href);

// Example accessing navigator information
console.log(navigator.userAgent);

// Example modifying location
window.location.href = 'https://example.com';

// Example accessing screen properties
console.log(screen.width);
console.log(screen.height);
</pre></div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The Browser Object Model (BOM) provides JavaScript with objects and methods for interacting with the browser environment. By leveraging BOM objects such as <code>window</code>, <code>navigator</code>, <code>location</code>, and <code>screen</code>, developers can create dynamic and interactive web applications that respond to user actions and browser settings.</p>
