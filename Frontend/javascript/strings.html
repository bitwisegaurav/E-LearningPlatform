    <h1>Strings in JavaScript</h1>

    <p>Strings in JavaScript are sequences of characters enclosed within single or double quotes. They represent textual data and provide various methods for manipulation and analysis. Understanding how to work with strings is fundamental for processing and displaying information in web development.</p>

    <h2>Creating Strings</h2>

    <p>Strings can be created using single quotes, double quotes, or backticks for template literals.</p>

    <div class="code"><pre>
let singleQuotes = 'This is a string with single quotes.';
let doubleQuotes = "This is a string with double quotes.";
let templateLiteral = `This is a template literal string.`;
</pre></div>

    <p class="note note-imp">When using single quotes, you cannot include single quotes within the string. The same applies to double quotes and template literal strings. However, you can use single quotes within double quotes or template literal strings, and vice versa.</p>

    <h2>String Escaping</h2>

    <p>Special characters in strings can be escaped using the backslash (\) character.</p>

    <div class="code"><pre>
let escapedString = "This is a \"quoted\" string.";
</pre></div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Strings are a fundamental data type in JavaScript, and their manipulation is essential for many programming tasks. Whether creating strings, using string methods, or leveraging template literals, a solid understanding of string handling is crucial for effective web development.</p>
