    <h1>Variables in JavaScript</h1>

    <p>Variables in JavaScript are containers that store data values. They play a crucial role in programming by allowing developers to store and manipulate information within their programs. In JavaScript, variables are dynamically typed, meaning the data type is determined at runtime.</p>

    <h2>Declaring Variables</h2>

    <p>Declaring variable age using <span>let keyword</span>.</p>

    <div class="code"><pre>let age = 25;</pre></div>

    <h2>Variable Naming Rules</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Variables must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).</li>
        <li>Subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).</li>
        <li>JavaScript is case-sensitive, so "name" and "Name" are different variables.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Const, Let and Var</h2>
    <p>There are three ways to declare variables in JavaScript:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span>const</span>: Variables declared with <span>const</span> are block-scoped and their values cannot be reassigned once they are initialized.</li>
        <li><span>let</span>: Variables declared with <span>let</span> are also block-scoped, but their values can be reassigned.</li>
        <li><span>var</span>: Variables declared with <span>var</span> are function-scoped and their values can be reassigned. However, they have some differences in behavior compared to <span>const</span> and <span>let</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Understanding how to declare and use variables is fundamental to programming in JavaScript. As you progress in your learning journey, you'll encounter different scenarios where variables play a crucial role in managing and manipulating data within your applications.</p>
