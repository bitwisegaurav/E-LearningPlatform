    <h1>Introduction to DOM, BOM, and Window Object</h1>

    <p>
      In JavaScript, the Document Object Model (DOM), Browser Object Model
      (BOM), and Window object collectively provide a foundation for building
      dynamic and interactive web applications. Let's explore each of these
      concepts:
    </p>

    <h2>Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>

    <p>
      The Document Object Model represents the structure of an HTML or XML
      document as a tree-like structure of objects. Each element in the
      document, such as <span>&lt;div&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>, or
      <span>&lt;img&gt;</span>, is represented as a node in the DOM tree.
      JavaScript can interact with and manipulate these nodes to dynamically
      change the content, structure, and style of a web page.
    </p>

    <p>
      A more detailed version will be covered in the next chapter on
      <span><a href="dom.html" target="sidesec">DOM</a></span
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Browser Object Model (BOM)</h2>

    <p>
      The Browser Object Model extends the capabilities of JavaScript beyond the
      scope of the document. It provides access to browser-specific features and
      functionality, such as controlling the browser window or tab, managing
      browser history, interacting with the browser's location bar, and handling
      browser events. The Window object is the top-level object in the BOM
      hierarchy and represents the browser window or tab that contains the
      document.
    </p>

    <h2>Window Object (with Additional Information and Examples)</h2>
    <p>
      The Window object is the top-level object in the Browser Object Model
      (BOM) hierarchy and represents the browser window or tab. It serves as a
      crucial component for manipulating the browser window, controlling
      navigation, and interacting with the user. Furthermore, the Window object
      functions as the global object for JavaScript in a browser environment,
      meaning that global variables and functions are properties of the Window
      object.
    </p>
    <h3>Properties and Methods</h3>
    <p>
      The Window object offers a wide range of properties and methods to work
      with:
    </p>
    <h4>Properties</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Window.innerWidth : </span> The inner width of the browser window in
        pixels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Window.innerHeight : </span> The inner height of the browser window in
        pixels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Window.location : </span> An object that contains information about the
        current URL and provides methods to change it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Window.document : </span> The Document object, representing the HTML
        document currently loaded in the browser window.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Window.navigator : </span> The Navigator object, containing information
        about the user's browser and operating system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Window.history : </span> The History object, providing access to the
        user's browsing history.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Methods</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Window.alert() : </span> Displays a message in a modal dialog box.</li>
      <li>
        <span>Window.prompt() : </span> Displays a dialog box that prompts the user to
        input a value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Window.confirm() : </span> Displays a dialog box with a message and two
        buttons, OK and Cancel.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Window.open() : </span> Opens a new browser window or tab with a specified
        URL.
      </li>
      <li><span>Window.close() : </span> Closes the current browser window or tab.</li>
      <li>
        <span>Window.scroll() : </span> Scrolls the content of the window to a specified
        position.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>JavaScript Global Object</h3>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, global variables and functions are automatically attached
      to the Window object, making them global in the browser environment.
      However, it is considered good practice to avoid using global variables
      due to potential naming conflicts and the lack of encapsulation.
    </p>
    <h3>Example Using the Window Object</h3>
    <p>
      The following example demonstrates how to use some properties and methods
      of the Window object:
    </p>
    <div class="code"><pre>
// Display the inner width and height of the browser window 
console.log(`Inner width: ${Window.innerWidth}, Inner height: ${Window.innerHeight}`); 

// Display the current URL 
console.log(`Current URL: ${Window.location.href}`); 

// Display the user agent (browser information) 
console.log(`User agent: ${Window.navigator.userAgent}`); 

// Open a new window 
Window.open('https://www.example.com'); 

// Display a simple alert dialog box 
Window.alert('This is an alert box!');</pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      Understanding the Document Object Model, Browser Object Model, and Window
      object is fundamental for developing modern web applications with
      JavaScript. These concepts enable developers to create dynamic,
      interactive, and responsive user experiences by manipulating the
      structure, content, and behavior of web pages.
