    <h1>CSS for Accessibility</h1>

    <p>Creating accessible web experiences is crucial to ensure that people with disabilities can use and navigate your site effectively. CSS plays a significant role in improving accessibility by enhancing the visual and interactive aspects of your web pages.</p>

    <h2>High Contrast and Readability</h2>

    <p>Ensure proper contrast between text and background colors for improved readability, especially for users with visual impairments. Follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for contrast ratios.</p>

    <h2>Responsive and Scalable Fonts</h2>

    <p>Use relative units like percentages or ems for font sizes to allow users to adjust text size according to their preferences. Avoid fixed font sizes that might hinder readability.</p>

    <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>

    <p>Employ semantic HTML elements to convey meaning and structure. Use headings, paragraphs, lists, and other semantic elements appropriately to enhance the understanding of content for screen readers and assistive technologies.</p>

    <h2>Focus Styles and Navigation</h2>

    <p>Ensure that interactive elements receive a visible focus indicator. This helps users who navigate through your site using a keyboard or assistive technologies. Use a focus style that contrasts with the background.</p>

    <h2>ARIA Roles and Attributes</h2>

    <p>Utilize ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content, such as single-page applications. Define landmarks, states, and properties to provide additional information to assistive technologies.</p>

    <h2>Skip Navigation Links</h2>

    <p>Include "skip navigation" links at the beginning of your document to allow keyboard users to bypass repetitive content and navigate directly to the main content.</p>

    <h2>CSS Animations and Transitions</h2>

    <p>Use CSS animations and transitions carefully. Provide options to pause, stop, or adjust the speed of animations to accommodate users with motion sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Test with Accessibility Tools</h2>

    <p>Regularly test your website for accessibility using tools like screen readers, browser extensions, and online validators. Address any issues identified to ensure a more inclusive user experience.</p>

    <p>By incorporating these CSS practices for accessibility, you contribute to building a web environment that can be accessed and enjoyed by users of all abilities.</p>
