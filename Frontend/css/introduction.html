    <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>

    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It allows you to control the layout, design, and appearance of multiple pages on a website, providing a consistent and visually appealing user experience.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

    <h3>Selectors:</h3>
    <p>CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles to them. Selectors can target elements based on their type, class, ID, or relationship with other elements.</p>

    <h3>Properties and Values:</h3>
    <p>Each CSS rule consists of a property and a value. Properties define the aspect of the element you want to style (e.g., color, font-size), and values specify how that property should be applied.</p>

    <h3>Cascading and Specificity:</h3>
    <p>The term "cascading" in CSS refers to the order in which styles are applied. Styles can cascade from a global stylesheet to a more specific rule. Specificity determines which rule takes precedence when multiple rules conflict.</p>

    <h3>Box Model:</h3>
    <p>The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that defines how elements are rendered on the page. It includes properties such as margin, border, padding, and content, influencing the size and spacing of elements.</p>

    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p>
        Comments are used to explain the code. They are ignored by the browser and are not displayed in the browser. You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you or other developers understand the code and its purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Comments can be added to your code using the following syntax:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
/* This is a single-line comment */
/* This is a
multi-line comment */</pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Why Use CSS</h2>

    <p>1. **Separation of Concerns:** CSS allows the separation of styling from the structure and content of a web page, making the code more maintainable and modular.</p>
    
    <p>2. **Consistency:** CSS enables the consistent styling of multiple pages, ensuring a uniform and professional look across an entire website.</p>

    <p>3. **Responsive Design:** With CSS, you can create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on various devices.</p>

    <p>4. **Enhanced User Experience:** CSS plays a crucial role in improving the visual appeal and usability of a website, contributing to a positive user experience.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>As you delve into CSS, you'll discover its power in transforming static HTML documents into dynamic and visually engaging web pages.</p>
