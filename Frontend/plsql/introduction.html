    <h1>PL/SQL Introduction</h1>

    <p>PL/SQL is a procedural language designed specifically for the Oracle Database management system. It stands for Procedural Language extension to SQL. It combines the power of SQL with the procedural functionality of programming languages like C.</p>
	<p>PL/SQL is a block structured language that enables developers to create complex applications and manipulate data in the database. It is integrated with SQL and provides support for various programming constructs such as loops, conditionals, variables, procedures, functions, and exception handling.</p>
