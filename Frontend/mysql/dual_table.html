    <h1>Dual Table</h1>
    <p>The DUAL is special one row, one column table present by default in all Oracle databases. The owner of DUAL is
        SYS (SYS owns the data dictionary, therefore DUAL is part of the data dictionary.) but DUAL can be accessed by
        every user. The table has a single VARCHAR2(1) column called DUMMY that has a value of 'X'. MySQL allows DUAL to
        be specified as a table in queries that do not need data from any tables. In SQL Server DUAL table does not
        exist, but you could create one.
        The DUAL table was created by Charles Weiss of Oracle corporation to provide a table for joining in internal
        views.

    </p>
    <p>The SELECT statement with DUAL table is useful in situations where we need to execute functions like SYSDATE() or
        VERSION() without selecting any particular table.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span>SYSDATE()</span> function returns the current date and time.</li>
        <li><span>VERSION()</span> function returns the version number of MySQL database.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Syntax :</p>
    <div class="code">
        mysql> select function from dual;
    </div>
    <p>Example :</p>
