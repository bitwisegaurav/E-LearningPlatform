    <h1>Views</h1>
    <p>A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. It contains rows and columns just like a real table, but the data is not stored in the database. Instead, the data is dynamically generated from the underlying tables/views each time the view is queried.</p>
    <p>Views are useful for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They provide a way to simplify complex SQL queries by encapsulating the query logic into a single view.</li>
      <li>They can be used to restrict data access by exposing only a subset of columns or rows from a table or joining multiple tables together.</li>
      <li>They can be used to summarize data, calculate derived values, or provide customized views of the data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Syntax:</p>
    <div class="code">
    CREATE [OR REPLACE] VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    </div>
    <p>The <span>OR REPLACE</span> option allows you to modify an existing view without having to drop and recreate it.</p>
    <p>Once a view is created, you can query it just like a table:</p>
    <div class="code">
SELECT * FROM view_name;
    </div>
    <p>Views can also be dropped using the following syntax:</p>
    <div class="code">
DROP VIEW view_name;
    </div>
    <p>Example :</p>
    <div class="structimg">
        <img src="../examples/mysql/view/view.PNG" alt="create database" class="hori">
