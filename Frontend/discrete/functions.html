    <h1>Functions</h1>
    
    <h2>What is a Function?</h2>
    <p>A function from A to B is a rule that assigns to each element of A exactly one element of B.</p>

    <h3>Domain</h3>
    <p>The domain of a function is the set of all possible inputs for the function.</p>

    <h3>Range</h3>
    <p>The range of a function is the set of all possible outputs or results of the function.</p>

    <h3>Co-Domain</h3>
    <p>The co-domain of a function is the set of all possible values that the output or result of the function can take.</p>

    <h2>Types of Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Injective (One-to-One) Function : </span>A function is said to be injective if it assigns a unique output to each input.</li>
        <li><span>Surjective (Onto) Function : </span>A function is said to be surjective if every element of the co-domain is the image of at least one element of the domain.</li>
        <li><span>Bijection (One-to-One Correspondence) : </span>A function is said to be bijective if it is both injective and surjective.</li>
        <li><span>Inverse Function : </span>The inverse of a function is a function that reverses the "direction" of the original function.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Important Terms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span>Equal functions : </span> Two functions f and g are equal if they have the same domain, the same codomain, and for every input in the domain, f(x) is equal to g(x).
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Constant functions : </span> A constant function is a function that always returns the same value regardless of the input. It maps every element in the domain to a single constant value in the codomain.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Identity mapping : </span> The identity mapping is a function that maps each element in the domain to itself. It preserves the original values and serves as the identity element for function composition.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Inverse mapping : </span> The inverse mapping of a function f is a function that undoes the effect of f. If f maps x to y, then the inverse mapping maps y back to x. Not all functions have an inverse.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Composition of functions : </span> The composition of two functions f and g is a new function denoted as (f âˆ˜ g), where the output of g is used as the input for f. It represents applying one function after another.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Composite function : </span> A composite function is the result of applying one function to the output of another function. It is obtained by performing the composition of two or more functions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Invertible function : </span> An invertible function is a function that has an inverse mapping. It means that for every y in the codomain, there exists a unique x in the domain such that f(x) = y.
        </li>
    </ul>
