    <h2>Problems with Traditional Business System</h2>
    <p><span>Traditional business is basically a local store</span> which offers its services or products to its local customers. Some of the major problems are : </p>
    <ul>

        <li><span>Fixed expenses/overhead : </span>You need to hire staff for sales, accounts, management and security.</li>
        <li><span>Huge investment in maintaining Stock : </span>Requires significant financial resources to manage and store inventory.</li>
        <li><span>Locality Limitation : </span>Your store has to be located centrally so that the customers can visit easily.</li>
        <li><span>Time Limitation : </span>Traditional showrooms run for limited time like from morning to evening and from Monday to Saturday only.</li>
        <li><span>Less scope for Expansion : </span>Little space of showroom/ office will limit the chances of expanding the business in future.</li>

    <h2>Traditional vs E-Commerce</h2>
    <p>Traditional commerce involves face-to-face interactions for selling products, with manual processing of transactions. It relies on physical stores and traditional payment methods facilitated by financial institutions. </p>

    <p>E-commerce expands business globally, enabling customers to access products worldwide. While both share common goals of delivering products efficiently, they differ in communication, order generation, and cost-effectiveness. E-commerce offers cost savings by eliminating the need for retail outlets and reducing overhead costs, making it a lucrative option for businesses of all sizes.</p>
