    <h1>Transmission Media</h1>

    <h2>What is Transmission Media?</h2>
    <p>Transmission media is a communication channel that carries the information from the sender to the receiver. Data is transmitted through electromagnetic signals. The main functionality of the transmission media is to carry the information in the form of bits through LAN (Local Area Network). It is a physical path between the transmitter and receiver in data communication.</p>

    <h2>Types of Transmission Media</h2>
    <p>Transmission Media is broadly classified into two types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Guided Media</li>
        <li>Unguided Media</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Guided Media</h3>
    <p>Guided Media, also referred to as Wired or Bounded transmission media, is where signals being transmitted are directed and confined in a narrow pathway by using physical links. It is characterized by its high speed, security, and is typically used for comparatively shorter distances. There are three major types of Guided Media:</p>

    <h4>Twisted Pair Cable</h4>
    <p>Twisted Pair Cable consists of 2 separately insulated conductor wires wound about each other. Generally, several such pairs are bundled together in a protective sheath.</p>
    <div class="structimg img-center mt-2"><img src="../examples/networks/transmission-media/twisted.jpeg" alt="Twisted Pair cable"></div>
    <p>They are the most widely used Transmission Media. Twisted Pair is of two types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)</li>
        <li>Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)</h5>
    <p>UTP consists of two insulated copper wires twisted around one another. This type of cable has the ability to block interference and does not depend on a physical shield for this purpose. It is used for telephonic applications.</p>

    <h5>Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)</h5>
    <p>This type of cable consists of a special jacket (a copper braid covering or a foil shield) to block external interference. It is used in fast-data-rate Ethernet and in voice and data channels of telephone lines.</p>

    <h4>Coaxial Cable</h4>
    <p>Coaxial Cable has an outer plastic covering containing an insulation layer made of PVC or Teflon and 2 parallel conductors each having a separate insulated protection cover. The coaxial cable transmits information in two modes: Baseband mode (dedicated cable bandwidth) and Broadband mode (cable bandwidth is split into separate ranges). Cable TVs and analog television networks widely use Coaxial cables.</p>

    <h4>Optical Fiber Cable</h4>
    <p>Optical Fiber Cable uses the concept of refraction of light through a core made up of glass or plastic.</p>

    <h3>Unguided Media</h3>
    <p>Unguided Media, also known as wireless media, is where the data is transmitted through the air and does not require a physical conductor or "guide" to take its path. It uses signals such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared and satellite communication. It provides flexible and mobile communication, but can suffer from interference and limited bandwidth.</p>
    <p>There are three major types of Unguided Media:</p>
    
    <h4>Radio Waves</h4>
    <p>Radio waves are electromagnetic waves that are transmitted in all the directions of free space. They are omnidirectional, i.e., the signals are propagated in all the directions. The range in frequencies of radio waves is from 3Khz to 1 khz. In the case of radio waves, the sending and receiving antenna are not aligned, i.e., the wave sent by the sending antenna can be received by any receiving antenna.</p>
    <div class="structimg img-center mt-2"><img src="../examples/networks/transmission-media/radiowave.jpeg" alt="Radio waves"></div>
    
    <h4>Microwaves</h4>
    <p>Microwaves are of two types: Terrestrial microwave and Satellite microwave communication. Terrestrial Microwave transmission is a technology that transmits the focused beam of a radio signal from one ground-based microwave transmission antenna to another. Microwaves are the electromagnetic waves having the frequency in the range from 1GHz to 1000 GHz. Microwaves are unidirectional as the sending and receiving antenna is to be aligned, i.e., the waves sent by the sending antenna are narrowly focused.</p>

    <h4>Infrared</h4>
    <p>Infrared waves, with frequencies from 300 GHz to 400 THz (wavelengths from 1 mm to 770 nm), can be used for short-range communication.</p>

    <h4>Advantages of Unguided Media</h4>
    <p>Some of the advantages of unguided media include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flexibility</li>
        <li>Mobility</li>
        <li>Allowing devices to communicate without the need for physical connections</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Disadvantages of Unguided Media</h4>
    <p>Despite its advantages, unguided media can be susceptible to interference.</p>

    <h2>Transmission Impairments</h1>
    <p>Transmission impairments refer to any form of distortion or degradation that occurs during the transmission of data over a network. They are caused by various factors and can significantly impact the quality and reliability of a communication system.</p>

    <h2>Types of Transmission Impairments</h2>
    <p>There are three major types of transmission impairments:</p>

    <h3>Attenuation</h3>
    <p>Attenuation refers to the loss of signal strength during transmission. As a signal travels through a medium, it loses power due to the resistance imposed by the environment. This results in a weaker signal at the receiving end.</p>

    <h3>Noise</h3>
    <p>Noise refers to any unwanted signal that gets added to the transmitted signal, modifying the resulting transmitted signal. It can be of various types, such as shot noise, impulse noise, thermal noise, etc.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Thermal noise</span> is caused by the random motion of the electrons in a wire and is unavoidable.</li>
        <li><span>Induced noise</span> comes from sources such as motors and appliances.</li>
        <li><span>Cross talk</span> is caused by the inductive coupling between two wires that are close to each other.</li>
        <li><span>Impulse</span> noise is a spike (a signal with high energy in a very short period of time) that comes from power lines, lightning etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Distortion</h3>
    <p>Distortion occurs mainly in case of composite signals, which have various frequency components. If a certain delay happens between the frequencies components, then there may be the chance that the frequency component will reach the receiver end with a different delay constraint from its original, leading to a change in the shape of the signal.</p>

    <h2>Performance Metrics</h2>
    <p>Performance metrics are quantitative measurements used to evaluate and monitor the performance and reliability of a computer network. They provide valuable insights into various aspects of network behavior, such as speed, bandwidth usage, latency, packet loss, and other network key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>

    <h2>Key Performance Metrics</h2>
    <p>Some of the most essential network performance metrics are:</p>

    <h3>Bandwidth</h3>
    <p>Bandwidth is the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted. It is one of the most essential conditions of a network's performance. Bandwidth is measured in bits per second (bps) or bytes per second for digital devices, and in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz), for analog devices.</p>

    <h3>Throughput</h3>
    <p>Throughput is the actual rate at which information is transmitted. It refers to the number of bits per second that a channel, a link, or a network can transmit.</p>

    <h3>Latency</h3>
    <p>Latency is the time it takes for data to reach its destination and back. It is also known as delay.</p>

    <h3>Jitter</h3>
    <p>Jitter is the variation in latency.</p>

    <h3>Packet Loss</h3>
    <p>Packet loss is the percentage of data packets that fail to reach their destination.</p>
