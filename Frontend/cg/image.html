    <h1>Images</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Images are visual representations that convey information, evoke emotions, and communicate ideas through graphical elements. In the realm of multimedia, images play a fundamental role in enhancing user experiences and conveying messages effectively.</p>

    <h2>Digital Image</h2>
    <p>A digital image is a numerical representation of a visual scene captured or created using digital technology. Digital images are composed of discrete pixels, each with specific color or grayscale values, arranged in a grid pattern.</p>
    
    <h3>Digital Image Format</h3>
    <p>There are two main formats associated with digital images:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Captured Image Format:</strong> Represents the format in which an image is initially captured, such as JPEG or RAW.</li>
        <li><strong>Stored Image Format:</strong> Refers to the format in which an image is stored digitally, such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, or TIFF.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bitmap Image</h3>
    <p>A bitmap image, also known as a raster image, is composed of a grid of pixels, where each pixel contains color information. Bitmap images are resolution-dependent and can exhibit pixelation when resized or scaled.</p>

    <h2>Making Still Image</h2>
    <p>Creating a still image involves capturing or generating a digital representation of a scene using imaging devices such as cameras or graphics software. The process may include adjusting settings, framing the composition, and capturing the image in a desired format.</p>

    <h2>Vectored Drawing</h2>
    <p>Vectored drawing involves creating graphics using geometric primitives, such as points, lines, curves, and shapes, defined by mathematical equations. Unlike bitmap images, vector graphics are resolution-independent and can be scaled without loss of quality.</p>

    <h2>Image Compression</h2>
    <p>Image compression techniques reduce the size of digital images to optimize storage and transmission efficiency. Compression exploits redundancies in image data and employs encoding algorithms to achieve compression while preserving image quality.</p>
    
    <h3>Redundancy</h3>
    <p>Image data exhibits redundancies in various forms, including spectral redundancy (similar color values), spatial redundancy (repetitive patterns), and temporal redundancy (similarities between successive frames in video).</p>

    <h3>Types of Compression</h3>
    <p>Image compression techniques can be categorized into lossless compression, which preserves all image data, and lossy compression, which sacrifices some data to achieve higher compression ratios.</p>

    <h4>Lossless Compression Techniques</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Run Length Encoding Algorithm</li>
        <li>Huffman Encoding Algorithm</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Lossy Compression Techniques</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)</li>
        <li>Fractal Image Compression</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Image File Formats</h2>
    <p>Image file formats define the structure and encoding of digital image data. Common image file formats include raster formats, which represent images as grids of pixels, and vector formats, which define graphics using mathematical paths.</p>

    <h3>Image Color Representations</h3>
    <p>Colors in digital images are represented using various color models, such as RGB (Red, Green, Blue), CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black), and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value). Each color model has its own advantages and applications in image processing and display.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Images are essential components of multimedia content, serving as visual assets that convey information, evoke emotions, and enhance user experiences. Understanding the principles of digital imaging, including image formats, compression techniques, and color representations, is crucial for multimedia professionals to create, manipulate, and optimize images effectively.</p>
