    <h1>Overview of Graphics Systems-I</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Graphics systems are essential for creating and displaying visual content using computers. This chapter provides an overview of graphics systems, covering basic terms and components of various display technologies.</p>

    <h2>Basic Terms</h2>
    <h3>Characteristics of Video Display</h3>
    <p>A video display device is characterized by its resolution, refresh rate, color depth, and aspect ratio.</p>
    
    <h3>Pixel</h3>
    <p>A pixel is the smallest unit of display on a screen, representing a single point in a graphical image.</p>
    
    <h3>DPI</h3>
    <p>DPI (Dots Per Inch) refers to the density of pixels on a display screen, indicating its resolution.</p>

    <h2>Monitor</h2>
    <h2>CRT</h2>
    <p>A Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube that produces images when an electron beam strikes its phosphorescent surface.</p>
    
    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>The components of a CRT include an electron gun, deflection coils, phosphor-coated screen, and glass envelope.</p>
    
    <h3>Working</h3>
    <p>The electron gun emits electron beams, which are deflected by the coils to scan across the screen, illuminating phosphor dots to create images.</p>
    
    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <p>CRT monitors offer high contrast, color accuracy, and response time, but they are bulky and consume more power compared to modern display technologies.</p>

    <h2>Color Monitors</h2>
    <p>Color monitors use different techniques to display colors, such as beam penetration and shadow mask.</p>
    
    <h3>Beam Penetration</h3>
    <p>In beam penetration, electron beams penetrate through layers of phosphor to produce different colors.</p>
    
    <h3>Shadow Mask</h3>
    <p>A shadow mask is a perforated metal sheet placed behind the phosphor screen to ensure that each electron beam hits the correct phosphor dot to produce colors.</p>

    <h2>DVST</h2>
    <p>Direct View Storage Tube (DVST) is a display device that stores an entire image in a memory tube, allowing fast and random access to any part of the screen.</p>

    <h2>Flat Panel Display</h2>
    <p>Flat panel displays are thin, lightweight screens that use various technologies to produce images.</p>
    
    <h3>Emissive Display</h3>
    <p>Emissive display technologies include Plasma Panel, Thin Film Electroluminescent, LED, and LCD.</p>
    
    <h4>Plasma Panel</h4>
    <p>Plasma panels use ionized gases to produce images with high brightness and color accuracy.</p>
    
    <h4>Thin Film Electroluminescent</h4>
    <p>Thin Film Electroluminescent displays use a thin film of phosphor sandwiched between two electrodes to emit light when an electric field is applied.</p>
    
    <h4>LED</h4>
    <p>LED (Light Emitting Diode) displays use an array of LEDs to produce images with high brightness and energy efficiency.</p>
    
    <h4>LCD</h4>
    <p>LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) uses liquid crystals to modulate light and produce images with low power consumption and high resolution.</p>

    <h2>Display Techniques</h2>
    
    <h2>Raster Scan Display</h2>
    <p>Raster scan display generates images by scanning electron beams across the screen in a series of horizontal lines.</p>
    
    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>Components include electron gun, deflection coils, phosphor-coated screen, and frame buffer.</p>
    
    <h3>Working</h3>
    <p>The electron beam scans across each line of the screen, illuminating phosphor dots to create images.</p>

    <h2>Random Scan Display</h2>
    <p>Random scan display directly draws images on the screen using a pen or stylus, allowing for quick and precise rendering of graphics.</p>
    
    <h3>Working</h3>
    <p>The pen or stylus moves across the screen to draw lines and shapes directly on the display surface.</p>
    
    <h2>Difference Between Raster and Random Scan System</h2>
    <p>Raster scan displays draw images using a fixed pattern of scanning lines, while random scan displays draw images directly without following a predefined pattern.</p>
    <h2>Calculate Frame Buffer Size</h2>
    <p>Frame buffer size is calculated based on the resolution, color depth, and refresh rate of the display.</p>
    
    <h3>Monochrome Monitor</h3>
    <p>For a monochrome monitor, the frame buffer size can be calculated using the formula:</p>
    <p>Frame Buffer Size = Resolution (width) x Resolution (height) x Color Depth (bits per pixel)</p>
    
    <h3>Color Monitor</h3>
    <p>For a color monitor, the frame buffer size calculation may vary based on the display technology and color depth.</p>
