    <h2>Dimension</h2>
    <p>
      In computer graphics, dimension refers to the size and scale of graphical
      elements within a digital image or drawing. Dimensions are often specified
      in terms of width, height, and depth, and are crucial for accurately
      representing objects and spaces in a graphical environment.
    </p>

    <h2>Image Rotation</h2>
    <p>
      Image rotation is the process of changing the orientation of a digital
      image by rotating it clockwise or counterclockwise around its center
      point. This allows users to adjust the orientation of images to better fit
      their intended layout or composition.
    </p>

    <h2>Area Calculation</h2>
    <p>
      Area calculation involves determining the size or extent of a
      two-dimensional space or region within a digital image. This can be useful
      for various purposes such as measuring land area, determining the
      dimensions of objects, or calculating the coverage area of graphical
      elements within a design.
    </p>

    <h2>Paint</h2>
    <p>
      Paint is a basic graphics software application that allows users to create
      and edit digital images using simple drawing tools and features. One of
      the most widely used paint applications is Microsoft Paint (MS-Paint),
      which comes pre-installed on Windows operating systems.
    </p>
