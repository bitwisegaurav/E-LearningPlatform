    <h1>File Formats</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>File formats play a crucial role in organizing and encoding data for storage, transmission, and playback in multimedia systems. Each type of multimedia content, including images, audio, video, and text, has specific file formats optimized for different purposes and requirements.</p>

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>Image file formats are used to store and display digital images. Common image formats include JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, and TIFF. Each format has its own characteristics and compression methods, suitable for different types of images and applications.</p>

    <h2>Audio File Format</h2>
    <p>Audio file formats are used to encode and store audio data. There are various types of audio formats, including:</p>
    <h3>Types of Format</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Uncompressed:</strong> Examples include WAV and AIFF formats, which preserve audio quality without compression.</li>
        <li><strong>Lossless:</strong> Formats like FLAC and ALAC offer compression without losing audio quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Lossy Compressed:</strong> Common formats such as MP3 and AAC compress audio data by removing some details, sacrificing quality for smaller file sizes.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Formats:</strong> Additional formats like OGG and WMA also exist, each with its own features and compatibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Video</h2>
    <p>Video file formats encode and store digital video data. Popular video formats include MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and WMV. These formats support various compression techniques, resolutions, frame rates, and audio codecs to accommodate different multimedia applications.</p>

    <h2>Text</h2>
    <p>Text file formats are used for storing textual data. Common text formats include plain text (TXT), Rich Text Format (RTF), and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Text files are widely used for documents, scripts, captions, and subtitles in multimedia content.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>File formats are essential components of multimedia systems, enabling the storage, transmission, and playback of digital content. Understanding the characteristics and capabilities of different file formats is crucial for multimedia professionals to effectively manage and optimize multimedia assets. By selecting appropriate file formats for images, audio, video, and text, multimedia content creators can ensure compatibility, quality, and efficiency throughout the multimedia production workflow.</p>
