        <li>Lower operational costs, end product prices and increased profits</li>
        <li>Reduce the cost of hiring workers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Setup can be extremely expensive</li>
        <li>Requires extensive site of CAD/CAM software</li>
        <li>CAD systems store data in their own proposed format, so it can often be a challenge to transfer data from CAD to CAM software</li>

        <li>Flexibility and customization: GUIs allow users to customize their interface preferences, such as themes, colors, and layout, to suit their individual needs and preferences, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Components</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><span>Windows:</span> GUIs typically feature multiple windows that display different parts of an application or document, allowing users to multitask and switch between tasks seamlessly.</li>
        <li><span>Menus:</span> Menus provide users with access to various commands, options, and settings organized into hierarchical lists, making it easy to navigate and control the application's functionality.</li>
        <li><span>Buttons:</span> Buttons are graphical elements that users can click or tap to perform specific actions, such as saving a file, submitting a form, or navigating to a different page.</li>
        <li><span>Icons:</span> Icons are visual symbols that represent files, folders, applications, or functions, providing a quick visual reference for users to identify and access commonly used features.</li>
        <li><span>Text fields:</span> Text fields allow users to input and edit text or numerical data, such as entering a username and password, typing a search query, or filling out a form.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        In summary, computer graphics have profoundly impacted various industries and fields by enabling new forms of visual communication, analysis, and interaction. From entertainment and business to science and engineering, graphical techniques continue to revolutionize how we process and gain insights from information.
