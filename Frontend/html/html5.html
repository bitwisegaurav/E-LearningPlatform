    <h1>HTML5 Features</h1>

    <p>HTML5 introduces several new features and elements that enhance the functionality and capabilities of web development. Let's explore some of the key features of HTML5.</p>

    <h2>Semantic Elements</h2>
    <p>HTML5 introduces new semantic elements that provide clearer structure to your documents. Examples include <span>&lt;article&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;section&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;header&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span>, and more.</p>

    <h2>Audio and Video Elements</h2>
    <p>HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content without the need for third-party plugins. The <span>&lt;audio&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;video&gt;</span> elements make it easy to integrate multimedia into web pages.</p>

    <h2>Canvas Element</h2>
    <p>The <span>&lt;canvas&gt;</span> element allows for dynamic rendering of graphics and images. It is particularly useful for creating interactive games, visualizations, and other multimedia content.</p>

    <h2>New Form Input Types</h2>
    <p>HTML5 introduces new input types, such as <span>&lt;input type="date"&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;input type="color"&gt;</span>, and <span>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</span>, providing better support for user input and enhancing the user experience.</p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The <span>localStorage</span> feature in HTML5 allows web applications to store data locally on a user's device. This enables persistent storage of user preferences, settings, and other data.</p>

    <h2>Geolocation API</h2>
    <p>The Geolocation API in HTML5 enables websites to access a user's geographical location. This is useful for location-based services, mapping applications, and other location-aware features.</p>

    <h2>Web Workers</h2>
    <p>Web Workers allow for the execution of JavaScript code in the background, separate from the main browser thread. This helps improve performance by handling tasks concurrently.</p>

    <h2>Drag and Drop API</h2>
    <p>The Drag and Drop API simplifies the process of implementing drag-and-drop functionality in web applications, making it easier for users to interact with and organize content.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>These HTML5 features contribute to a more dynamic, interactive, and multimedia-rich web experience. As HTML5 continues to evolve, developers can leverage these features to create modern and engaging web applications.</p>
