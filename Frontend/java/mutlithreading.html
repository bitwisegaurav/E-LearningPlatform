    <h1>Multithreading in Java</h1>
    <p>
        Multithreading is a feature in Java that allows concurrent execution of two or more threads. A thread is a lightweight process, and multithreading is a way to improve the performance of your programs by executing multiple tasks concurrently.
    </p>
    <p>Main is also known as parent thread because all execution starts from their and all other threads are child threads of main thread.</p>
    <p>Qualified name of thread class is <span>java.lang.Thread</span>.</p>

    <h2>Creating and Managing Threads</h2>
    <p>
        In Java, there are two ways to create threads: 
        <ol>
            
            <li><span>By implementing the Runnable interface :</span>
                <p>If we user Runnable interface, then we have to override a function, that is run function. Whenever a thread is executed, then it always execute the run function.</p>
                <p>To override the run function, we will use the following syntax : </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre>public void run() {</pre>
                </div>
                <p>For example :</p>
                <!-- Example: Implementing Runnable Interface -->
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed in the new thread
    }
}

// Creating and starting a thread
Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
thread.start();</pre>
    </div>
            </li>
            <li><span>By extending the Thread class :</span>
                <p>If we implements Runnable interface then we have to create threads using <span>Thread</span> class which can takes objects of a class which implements Runnable as argunments.</p>
                <p>And to run a thread, we used to call a function known as <span>start</span>. And we cannot call <span>run</span> function directly.</p>
                <p>For example :</p>
                <!-- Example: Extending Thread Class -->
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed in the new thread
    }
}

// Creating and starting a thread
MyThread thread = new MyThread();
thread.start();</pre>
    </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Commonly Used Functions in Multithreading</h2>

    <h3>1. start()</h3>
    <p>
        The <span>start()</span> method is used to begin the execution of a thread. It invokes the <span>run()</span> method on the thread, and the new thread begins its life cycle.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
MyThread thread = new MyThread();
thread.start();</pre>
    </div>

    <h3>2. join()</h3>
    <p>
        The <span>join()</span> method is used to wait for a thread to finish its execution before moving on to the next step. It ensures that the current thread waits until the specified thread completes.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
thread.start();
try {
    thread.join();
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}</pre>
    </div>

    <h3>3. sleep()</h3>
    <p>
        The <span>sleep()</span> method is used to pause the execution of a thread for a specified duration. It allows other threads to run during the sleep period.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
try {
    Thread.sleep(1000); // Sleep for 1 second
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}</pre>
    </div>

    <h3>4. yield()</h3>
    <p>
        The <span>yield()</span> method is used to temporarily pause the execution of the currently running thread, allowing other threads of the same priority to run.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
Thread.yield();</pre>
    </div>

    <h3>5. isAlive()</h3>
    <p>
        The <span>isAlive()</span> method is used to check whether a thread is still alive (has started and not yet terminated) or not.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
thread.start();
boolean aliveStatus = thread.isAlive();</pre>
    </div>

    <h3>6. setPriority()</h3>
    <p>
        The <span>setPriority()</span> method is used to set the priority of a thread. Threads with higher priority get more preference in execution.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
MyThread highPriorityThread = new MyThread();
highPriorityThread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);

MyThread lowPriorityThread = new MyThread();
lowPriorityThread.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);</pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Synchronization</h2>
    <p>
        In multithreading, synchronization is crucial to ensure that threads don't interfere with each other. The <span>synchronized</span> keyword is used to achieve synchronization.
    </p>
    <!-- Example: Synchronization -->
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}</pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Multithreading is a powerful feature in Java that enables concurrent execution. Understanding how to create and manage threads, along with synchronization techniques, is essential for building efficient and responsive applications.
