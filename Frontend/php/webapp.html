    <h1>Web Applications</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Web applications are software programs that run on web servers and are
        accessed by users over the internet through a web browser.
      </li>

      <li>
        They dynamically generate web pages and content instead of serving
        static HTML files. This allows for more interactive and customizable
        experiences.
      </li>

      <li>
        Common examples include web-based email, social media sites, shopping
        carts, banking portals, wikis, blogs, online games, and countless other
        apps powered by the web.
      </li>

      <li>
        Web apps handle user input through web page forms, clicks, and other
        actions that get sent to the server. The server processes the requests
        and returns new page content.
      </li>

      <li>
        Web apps involve web development using languages like HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript on the front-end and languages like PHP, Python, Java, .NET
        on the back-end.
      </li>

      <li>
        Typical web app architecture has a client-server model with a front-end
        UI, back-end database/logic, and HTTP protocol for communication.
      </li>

      <li>
        Web apps can range from simple static sites to complex single-page apps
        that rely heavily on asynchronous communication and dynamic updating.
      </li>

      <li>
        Common challenges in web app development include state management,
        real-time synchronization, security, and optimizing performance.
      </li>

      <li>
        Popular frameworks like React, Angular, Django, Rails provide structures
        to help build and deploy robust web apps efficiently.
      </li>

      <li>
        Web apps are ubiquitous due to cross-platform accessibility, efficient
        delivery over HTTP, and ability to update codebase centrally on the
        server.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Benefits of Web Applications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Platform-independent access via a web browser.</li>
      <li>
        Easy maintenance and updates, as changes are made on the server side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Global accessibility, allowing users to access applications from
        anywhere.
      </li>
      <li>Centralized data storage and management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitations of Web Applications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dependent on internet connectivity.</li>
      <li>Potential security vulnerabilities if not properly secured.</li>
      <li>
        Performance may be affected by server load and network congestion.
      </li>
      <li>Compatibility issues across different web browsers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scripting</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Client-Side Scripting : </span>
            <ul>
                <li>Runs in the web browser on the user's device, not on the web server.</li>
                <li>Typically uses JavaScript to dynamically manipulate DOM, handle user, validate input, update UI, etc.</li>
                <li>Can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary server requests.</li>
                <li>But cannot directly access server resources like databases</li>.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span>Server-Side Scripting : </span>
            <ul>
                <li>Runs on the web server before page is sent to the user's browser.</li>
                <li>
                    Common languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, ASP.NET.
                    Can access databases, file systems, external APIs on the server.
                </li>
                <li>Dynamically generates HTML, CSS, JavaScript sent to client.</li>
                <li>Handles core application logic, computations, security.</li>
                <li>Enables dynamic, database-driven web applications.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Web Servers</h2>
    <p>Web applications can run on both local and remote web servers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Web Server:</strong> Used for development and testing on a
        local machine (e.g., XAMPP, WampServer).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Remote Web Server:</strong> Hosts web applications on the
        internet, making them accessible globally.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Static and Dynamic Websites</h2>
    <p>Web applications can be categorized as static or dynamic:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Static Websites:</strong> Content remains the same for all
        users. HTML and CSS are used for presentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dynamic Websites:</strong> Content changes based on user
        interactions and data from databases. PHP, along with other server-side
        technologies, enables dynamic web applications.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Web applications powered by PHP offer numerous benefits, such as global
      accessibility and easy maintenance, while also presenting challenges like
      security and performance considerations. Understanding client-side and
      server-side scripting, web server options, and the difference between
      static and dynamic websites is crucial for building successful web
      applications.
