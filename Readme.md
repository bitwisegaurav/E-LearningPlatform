## How to Use

This project consists of a backend and a frontend. Here's how you can run them:

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `Backend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd Backend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `Frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../Frontend
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser. You can do this by running a local server on ports `5500` or `5501`. <br> If you're using the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code, it will automatically choose an available port when you open the `index.html` file with the `Open with Live Server` option.
